This is a simple example of how you can fetch streams with a (python) Discord bot in a specific category using the Twitch API. I also have other code for specific users instead of categories.

I have code posted in my other repos for example code on how to obtain your OAUTH token to use this code. Other stuff like your client_id is easy to find online. 

Make sure to install discord.py and requests:

pip install requests
pip install discord.py
